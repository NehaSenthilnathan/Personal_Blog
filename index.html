The Teppakulam at the foot of the Rockfort is surrounded by bazaars. It has a mandapa at its centre and has facilities for boat riding.

Built by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the memorial reflects India's ethnic diversity and rich cultural heritage. As you enter the memorial, the entrance depicts the India Gate and has a Chettinad door integrated into the structure. The main dome of the building is a replica of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The memorial houses a life-sized bronze statue of the legendary scientist. Visitors can also see replicas of rockets and missiles that Dr Kalam worked on. The memorial has four halls that provide a deep insight into the life and time of the late scientist through various exhibits, which also include a few personal belongings of Dr Kalam. The memorial lies a stone's throw from Rameswaram and makes for an interesting visit.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted text-left">We visited a turtle hatchery near the rekwa beack. We got to see little baby turtles hatching from the eggs. The eggs were actually burried in the sand untill the eggs hatch and once the turtle comes out, it is put in a big tank filled with water. There were so many tanks with turtles of different sizes and some were of different shapes too. There were some rare species of turtles too. After the hatchery, we went to the rekawa beack. It was around 4 at that time. We went on a ship, obviously with a experiencesd guide. The ship had a transparent glass at the bottom so we can see the sea creatured. Soon as we left a rain started approaching, so we decided to head back :( </p>

     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Severe flooding in the southern Indian state of Kerala has killed at least 370+ people in the past week.
         <br>
Kerala Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has called this current flood “the worst monsoon disaster since 1924."
<br>
Following torrential monsoon rains, many cities had totally become submerged under water. God's own country saw massive destruction, loss of property and precious lives. Now that the flood water is receding, we know it is going to be a long way to recovery and rebuilding of the state. Kerala is left with collapsed buildings, unlivable conditions in houses that stayed intact with swamp-like dirt infested with disease-borne conditions. While the people of Kerala have all come together, united to rebuild their lives, with optimism and perseverance, they still need a lot of YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT!</p>
